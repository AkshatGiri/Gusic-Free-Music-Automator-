# Gusic-Free-Music-Automator-
This is a project that uses existing python libraries to automate downloading songs from youtube and uploading it Google Music free service. Essentially giving you all Music you could ask for. 


After you set everything up, which is a hassle you will be able to text a number the name of a song which will then be downloaded and uploaded automatically to your [Google Music](https://play.google.com/music/) account. 

Currently I am using - 
1. [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to host the app. 
2. [Twilio](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) to send and receive Messages
3. [Pafy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pafy) to download the audio from Youtube video. 
4. [gmusicapi](https://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to upload the audio file to your Google Music account. 

Bugs - This app does not text back when the processes is completed. 

I will soon be making a tutorial on how to set everything up and use it. 
Unfortunately it is not going to be easy as clicking a button, but it going to be totally worth it.
