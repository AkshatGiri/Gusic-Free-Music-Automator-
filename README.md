# Gusic-Free-Music-Automator-
This is a project that uses existing python libraries to automate downloading songs from youtube and uploading it Google Music free service. Essentially giving you all Music you could ask for. 


I will soon be making a tutorial on how to set everything up and use it. 
Unfortunately it is not going to be easy as clicking a button, but it going to be totally worth it.
